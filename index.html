                <p>Living during the pandemic and the shelter-in-place makes people want to try out old and new activities that they can try in the comfort of their home. If people want to try out musical instruments, some people may worried that buying musical instruments are too much of an investment and takes a lot of time to learn fluently. UC Berkeley graduate Andie San Gabriel has grown up playing musical instruments and has sometimes faced financial hardships. "I loved playing instruments, whether that's the piano or the ukulele, but it does take out a lot of money so I would save up months beforehand," San Gabriel said.</p>

                <p>Luckily, there are some musical instruments that are cheap and easy to play. One of these instruments is the kalimba, a thumb piano that originates from Africa that has long metal bars and plays high pitches when they are plucked. "I purchased the kalimba recently because I seen it on TikTok and it didn't take that long to play the kalimba well," San Gabriel stated. "Even though being musically gifted made it easy for me to learn, I think it's a good place for everyone who wants to try out a musical instrument without spending too much money and time."</p>

                <p>After you purchased your kalimba, one of the first things you should learn are the parts of the kalimba. What's most important are the long metal rods, or the "tines." The tines are arranged by letters, numbers, and sometimes dots. The dots (whether it's one dot or two) indicate that they're a higher pitch the more dots there are. If you test it out with two tines that have the same letter but one has a dot and the other doesn't, you can tell they play a different sound and tone.</p>

                <p>How you play the notes is pretty simple. Since the kalimba only involves using the thumb, hold the kalimba with your hands and keep your thumbs open so that you can play the kalimba. From there, you play the notes by pushing the lower end of the tines and pluck it through. </p>

                <p>Once you're used to the notes, you can try out playing a song. You can find some of the resources of the songs I practiced playing down below. There may be some forms of learning to play that won't understand. However, there is the textual instructions that I personally find easier to learn within minutes. Down below is a sample of the song "Avatar's Love" from the TV show Avatar: The Last Airbender":</p>

                <p>One of the things you need to know as you read these notes is that when you find notes that are in parentheses and hyphened, that indicates that you play the two notes simultaneously. Another thing is that you can see notes that have the degree symbol. That means you play that certain note that has the dot, depending how many degree symbols you see on the text. Lastly, when you see the multiplier, you would have to play the entire line of notes repetitively, depending on how many times it tells you to play. Give it a try and see if playing it on the kalimba sounds similar to the original song.</p>

                <h2>After Practicing</h2>
                <p>Now that you finally learned the basics of the kalimba, you can try out more songs until you're a pro at it. You can find other songs that are easier to play with this instrument and a link to a website that offers more songs if you want to explore more. Hopefully, you learned a lot from this simple tutorial and thanks for learning from me!</p>
